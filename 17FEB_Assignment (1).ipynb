    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "ANS:---->\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that uses a JSON-like \n",
    "document model to store data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB is a non-relational database,\n",
    "which means it does not use a structured table schema to organize and store data. \n",
    "Instead, it uses collections and documents to store data, which can have different fields and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management \n",
    "system that do not use the traditional relational data model used in SQL databases. \n",
    "Instead, they use a variety of data models such as document, key-value, column-family,\n",
    "and graph data models to store and manage data. Non-relational databases are often used\n",
    "for large-scale and complex applications that require flexibility, scalability, and high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in several scenarios, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Applications that require high scalability: MongoDB is designed to handle \n",
    "large volumes of data and can be easily scaled horizontally to support the \n",
    "growing needs of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Applications that require high availability: MongoDB supports automatic failover \n",
    "and replica sets, which ensures that data is always available and accessible, even in\n",
    "the event of a node failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Applications that require flexible and dynamic data structures: MongoDB's document-oriented \n",
    "data model allows for flexible and dynamic data structures, making it ideal for applications \n",
    "that require frequently changing data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Applications that require real-time analytics and reporting: MongoDB's aggregation \n",
    "framework and other built-in features make it easy to perform real-time analytics and\n",
    "generate reports on large datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers several key features, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Flexible data model: MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model that allows for \n",
    "flexible and dynamic data structures. This means that data can be stored in a way that\n",
    "makes sense for the application, rather than having to conform to a rigid table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scalability: MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and can be easily scaled \n",
    "horizontally across multiple servers, making it ideal for applications that require high scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.High availability: MongoDB supports automatic failover and replica sets, which ensure that data\n",
    "is always available and accessible, even in the event of a node failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Indexing and querying: MongoDB supports efficient indexing and querying, making it easy\n",
    "to search and retrieve data from large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Aggregation and reporting: MongoDB's aggregation framework and other built-in \n",
    "features make it easy to perform real-time analytics and generate reports on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Support for geospatial data: MongoDB includes support for geospatial data, making it\n",
    "easy to work with location-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Multi-document transactions: MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, \n",
    "which allows for multiple operations to be grouped together and executed as a single transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Horizontal scalability: MongoDB supports sharding, which enables horizontal scaling of\n",
    "the database across multiple machines, enabling better performance and throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.Document validation: MongoDB supports document validation to ensure that documents \n",
    "conform to specific rules, enabling the database to maintain data quality.\n",

For example, if we want to delete all documents with a specific field value, we can use the following code: mycol.delete_many({\"field\": \"value\"}). This method will delete all documents that match the specified filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "drop(): This method is used to drop the entire collection. This means that all the documents in the collection will be permanently deleted, and the collection itself will be removed.

For example, we can use the following code to drop the mycol collection: mycol.drop().\n",
